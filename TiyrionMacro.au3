; Guess we should start :o
; I hope you'll get github to work :p

; To my mind, we should do a configuration GUI at the beginning but after that we shouldn't use any gui
; cuz it's pretty hard to work with radio/checkboxes/etc while using the macro

;we will remake your _Keys function and also make the macro faster :p

;Oh i got 2 fucking nice ideas

;1/
;functions with args:
;ingame, if we type sth like /macro blabla args
;then we can start a macro
;like /macro tbf 15
; do 15 tbf in a row
; if you type /macro blabla
;it appears in the chat?
; then do the same with /clan or /idkwhat

;2/
; make a function that will do random moves
; sth like tbf then blockrush then tiger gate 1 or 2 times then idkwhat, etc
; would be awesum


;oh and also, if we register a function that check for keypresses with AdlibRegister ?
;will it works ?

;Idea #1 - No. We'd need to acces ZChatCmd, which is gunz function. I think there was an incldue that could let
;you read memory, but i tried finding functions on FG, and couldn't.

;Idea #3 - I did this in my new macr0, is okai.
