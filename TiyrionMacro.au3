; Guess we should start :o
; I hope you'll get github to work :p

; To my mind, we should do a configuration GUI at the beginning but after that we shouldn't use any gui
; cuz it's pretty hard to work with radio/checkboxes/etc while using the macro

;we will remake your _Keys function and also make the macro faster :p
